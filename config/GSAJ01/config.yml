# NOTE: All paths in this file can utilize decomp-toolkit's VFS (virtual file system).
# This allows you to directly reference files inside of containers (disc images, .arc, etc.).
# Files compressed with Yaz0 (SZS), Yay0 (SZP) are automatically decompressed.
# Files compressed with NLZSS (Nintendo LZSS) can use a `:nlzss` suffix to decompress.
# See https://github.com/encounter/decomp-toolkit#vfs-ls for more information on the VFS.

game_name: Star Fox Adventures (JP)

# (optional) Main module name. Defaults to "main".
name: main

# Path to the main.dol file.
object: sys/main.dol

# (optional) SHA-1 hash of the main.dol file for verification.
hash: a0646def31229c051f5143e6551840e6560b0556

# (optional) If set, all object paths will be relative to this directory.
# If not set, all object paths will be relative to the root of the project.
# decomp-toolkit will search the root of this directory for any disc images. (ISO, RVZ, WBFS, etc.)
# If a disc image is found, decomp-toolkit will fetch all objects from the disc image instead of the filesystem.
# For example, if `game.iso` exists in the `object_base`, the object path would become the VFS path
# `orig/GAMEID/game.iso:sys/main.dol`. See information on the VFS above.
object_base: orig/GSAJ01

# (optional) If true, objects will be extracted from a disc image into `object_base`.
# This allows users to delete the disc image after the initial build to save space.
# Enabled by default if `object_base` is set.
extract_objects: true

# (optional) Path to the symbols.txt file.
# This file will be created if it does not exist.
# See docs/symbols.md for more information.
symbols: config/GSAJ01/symbols.txt

# (optional) Path to the splits.txt file.
# This file will be created if it does not exist.
# See docs/splits.md for more information.
splits: config/GSAJ01/splits.txt

# (optional) Version used to generate `.comment` sections in the split objects.
# If not specified, no `.comment` sections will be generated.
# See docs/comment_section.md for more information.
# Known versions:
# 8 - CodeWarrior for GameCube 1.0+
# 10 - CodeWarrior for GameCube 1.3.2+
# 11 - CodeWarrior for GameCube 2.7+
# 14 - CodeWarrior for GameCube 3.0a3+
mw_comment_version: 11

# (optional) When enabled, function boundary analysis will be skipped.
# Only valid _after_ initial analysis has been performed and
# the symbols and splits files have been generated. 
quick_analysis: false

# (optional) When enabled, the analyzer will attempt to detect sizes
# and data types of objects based on code usage and alignment.
detect_objects: true

# (optional) When enabled, the analyzer will attempt to detect strings,
# wide strings, and string tables.
detect_strings: true

# (optional) Whether to write disassembly to the split output directory.
# While not used in the build process, the disassembly is useful
# for reading and usage with other tools, like decomp.me.
write_asm: true

# (optional) If symbols are _fully_ known (e.g. from a complete map file),
# this can be set to true to skip most analysis steps, and ensure new
# symbols are not created by the analyzer.
# If you're not sure, leave this false.
symbols_known: false

# (optional) Whether to create `gap_` symbols to prevent the linker from
# adjusting the alignment / address of symbols.
# When alignments are fully known (e.g. from a complete map file),
# this can be set to false.
fill_gaps: true

# (optional) By default, emitted objects will "export" all symbols (force active).
# This is useful to prevent the linker from removing any symbols.
# Individual symbols can be excluded using `noexport` in the symbols file.
export_all: true

# (optional) Scrub uninitialized data from the extab section.
# Certain extab acctions contain uninitialized data from the compiler.
# Affected games can use `dtk extab clean in.dol out.dol` to get a DOL with
# the uninitialized data zeroed out. When targeting a cleaned DOL hash,
# this option can be set to true to scrub the uninitialized data from 
# the extab section in the split objects.
#
# Alternatively, you can set extab_padding on any affected objects in
# configure.py, in order to exactly match the original DOL.
clean_extab: false
