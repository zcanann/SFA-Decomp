# web_dump.gdb — per-web Select/fallback tracer

Companion to `validate_select.sh`. Breaks on Color_Select's assignment
(0x50899e) and the reserved-reg fallback (0x5089c4) and prints, for every
colored web: class, web index (+0x10), static degree/nadj (+0x18), and the
chosen register. Driver entries (0x508680) delimit per-class passes.

    gdb -batch -x tools/mwcc_re/web_dump.gdb --args \
      build/tools/wibo build/compilers/GC/2.0/mwcceppc.exe <FLAGS> -c <unit.c> -o /tmp/out.o

Read the output as: `F idx=.. nadj=.. reg=..` lines are saved-register
(fallback) assignments in stack-pop order — the r31-descending sequence.
Diagnosed on mmp_moonrock_update: a saved-pair mismatch vs retail is decided
by (web index, static degree) pop order; function-scope decl order shifts a
named local's web index (first decl → highest), block decl order does not.
The vreg-numbering rule that fixes cross-scope index gaps (e.g. def idx38 vs
list idx35 with target wanting def < list) is still undecoded — that is the
next unlock for the reg-perm family.
